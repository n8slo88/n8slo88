  This is a personal Repo with various projects.  Some are from Certification courses in Data Engineering and Software Engineering, some are for fun.

My full stack projects are set to private for security reasons.  You can check out [https://earbux.com] full stack using Supabase, NexJS, stripe Api and much more.
